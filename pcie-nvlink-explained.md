# üîå PCIe and NVLink in NVIDIA GPUs

This document explains in detail the architecture, use cases, and hierarchical roles of **PCIe** and **NVLink** in NVIDIA GPUs. These components serve as the primary **interconnect mechanisms** between CPUs, GPUs, and across GPU clusters.

---

## üì¶ Where They Fit in GPU Architecture

Both **PCIe** and **NVLink** are essential for:
- Connecting GPUs to CPUs.
- Enabling GPU-to-GPU communication.
- Scaling systems with multiple GPUs.

They are **not part of the core GPU die**, but are **external communication interfaces**.

## üß© PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)

### ‚úÖ Features:
- Standard interface for **CPU-to-GPU communication**.
- Supports multiple lane configurations: x1, x4, x8, x16.
- Each new PCIe version doubles the bandwidth.

| PCIe Version | x16 Bandwidth (Bi-directional) | Latency (Approx) |
|--------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| PCIe 3.0     | ~16 GB/s                       | 200‚Äì300 ns       |
| PCIe 4.0     | ~32 GB/s                       | Slightly lower   |
| PCIe 5.0     | ~64 GB/s                       | Slightly lower   |
| PCIe 6.0     | ~128 GB/s (future)             | Lower            |

### üîß Use Cases:
- Connecting **single GPU systems** (e.g., desktops, laptops).
- **General-purpose data movement** (CPU <-> GPU).
- GPU support for **rendering, gaming, media acceleration**.

## üîó NVLink

### ‚úÖ Features:
- Developed by NVIDIA for **high-speed GPU-GPU and CPU-GPU** communication.
- **Point-to-point** or **mesh** interconnect.
- **Significantly lower latency** and **higher throughput** than PCIe.

| NVLink Version | Bandwidth Per Link (Bi-dir) | Example GPU     |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| NVLink v2      | ~50 GB/s                    | V100             |
| NVLink v3      | ~100 GB/s                   | A100             |
| NVLink v4      | ~200 GB/s                   | H100             |

### üìà Use Cases:
- **Deep Learning** model training (multi-GPU).
- **Supercomputers and AI Clusters** with NVSwitch.
- Memory sharing across GPUs (Unified Memory).

### üîß NVLink Topologies:

  [ GPU0 ]‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ[ GPU1 ]
     ‚îÇ          ‚îÇ
  [ GPU2 ]‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ[ GPU3 ]

  Or with **NVSwitch**:

    [ GPU0 ]     [ GPU1 ]
     ‚îÇ  \     /   ‚îÇ
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NVSwitch ‚îÄ‚îò
     /   ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ   \\
  [ GPU2 ]     [ GPU3 ]
