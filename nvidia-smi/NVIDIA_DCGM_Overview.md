# NVIDIA DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager) – Overview and Architecture

---

## 📌 What is DCGM?

**NVIDIA DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager)** is a powerful suite of tools, services, and APIs developed by NVIDIA to manage and monitor **NVIDIA GPUs** in large-scale deployments such as data centers, HPC clusters, AI/ML servers, and cloud environments.

It helps administrators **monitor health, performance, and reliability** of GPUs, run diagnostics, and integrate GPU metrics into monitoring stacks like **Prometheus, Grafana, or DCGM Exporter**.

## 🎯 Key Features of DCGM

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🩺 Health Monitoring | Checks for ECC errors, clock throttling, temperature issues, etc. |
| 📊 Performance Stats | Utilization, memory usage, power draw, clock speeds, etc. |
| 📉 Telemetry | Detailed GPU telemetry through API or command line |
| 🧪 Diagnostics | Run built-in GPU diagnostics and stress tests |
| 🔄 Integration | Supports Prometheus, Kubernetes, SLURM, and more |
| 🔐 Isolation | Provides isolation policies for safe GPU use in shared environments |

## 🔍 Breakdown of Components

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| `dcgmi` | Command-line tool to interact with DCGM |
| `dcgm-service` | Daemon/service running on the host that collects and manages GPU metrics |
| `libdcgm.so` | C/C++ shared library for programmatic access to DCGM |
| `NVML` | NVIDIA Management Library used by DCGM to communicate with the driver |
| `GPU Driver` | The kernel-level driver providing low-level GPU access |

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. **DCGM Service** runs on each node (like a daemon) and collects GPU stats using NVML.
2. Admins or software access this info via:
   - **`dcgmi`** (CLI)
   - **DCGM APIs** (C/C++ or Python via bindings)
3. Health checks and diagnostics can be run in real-time or scheduled.
4. The service supports **remote queries**, **group-based monitoring**, and **job-level metrics**.
5. Telemetry data can be **exported to Prometheus** or viewed on **Grafana dashboards**.

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

- **GPU-aware scheduling** in Kubernetes
- GPU diagnostics in HPC clusters
- Monitoring GPU utilization and failures
- Alerting when GPUs reach critical temperatures or fail health checks
- Pre- and post-job GPU health validation

---

## 🛠️ Tools Provided

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dcgmi` | CLI to run health checks, view stats, manage jobs |
| `dcgm-exporter` | Exposes DCGM metrics to Prometheus |
| DCGM APIs | C/C++ APIs for integration in schedulers or apps |

---

## 📌 Sample DCGM Commands

```bash
# Check all GPUs status
dcgmi discovery -l

# Run diagnostic on all GPUs
dcgmi diag -r 1

# Monitor GPU stats
dcgmi stats --group 0 -e -d  # enable stats
dcgmi stats --group 0 -v     # view stats

# Check GPU health
dcgmi health --check
```
