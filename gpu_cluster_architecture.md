# ðŸ§  Deep Dive: GPU Components, Tensor Cores, Clusters, and Warp Execution

## 1. Tensor Cores & Specialized Units

Tensor Cores are specialized units in modern GPUs designed for high-throughput matrix operations, essential in AI and scientific computing.

### Key Features:
- **Tensor Cores** perform mixed-precision matrix multiply-accumulate operations.
- Found in architectures like Volta, Turing, Ampere, Hopper.
- Hopper (H100) introduces FP8 support, DPX instructions, and TMA for efficient memory movement.

## 2. GPU Hierarchy: From Clusters to Execution Units

Modern NVIDIA GPU architectures are structured as follows:

### â–¶ Graphics Processing Cluster (GPC)
- Contains multiple Texture Processing Clusters (TPCs), raster engines, etc.

### â–¶ Texture Processing Cluster (TPC)
- Typically includes 2 SMs and texture units.

### â–¶ Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)
- Core programmable unit containing:
  - CUDA cores
  - Tensor Cores
  - SFUs (Special Function Units)
  - LSUs (Load/Store Units)
  - Shared memory
  - Warp scheduler

### â–¶ Thread Block Cluster
- Introduced in Hopper.
- Groups thread blocks across multiple SMs for sync/cooperation.

## 3. Warp and Execution Model

- **Warp**: Group of 32 threads executed in lock-step.
- **Warp Scheduler**: Chooses which warp to run each cycle.
- Warps operate in SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Thread) style.
- SMs can run up to 64 warps concurrently to hide memory latency.

| Unit         | Purpose                         |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| CUDA Core    | FP32 and integer instructions    |
| Tensor Core  | Matrix math for AI workloads     |
| SFU          | Trig, exp, log functions         |
| LSU          | Memory instructions              |

## 5. GPU Cluster-Level Architecture

### Components:
- **GPU Nodes** with multiple GPUs (e.g. H100).
- **NVLink/NVSwitch** for GPU-GPU interconnect (~900 GB/s).
- **RDMA NICs** for fast inter-node comms.
- **MIG (Multi-Instance GPU)** for workload isolation.

### Orchestration:
- Kubernetes, SLURM, or Ray manage scheduling across clusters.
