# üß† GPU Architecture: Components and Functionality

## What is a GPU?
A **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)** is a specialized processor designed for parallel computation, commonly used in graphics rendering and general-purpose compute tasks like AI, simulations, and video processing.

## üß© Components of a GPU

### 1. Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) / Compute Units
- Includes ALUs, registers, warp scheduler, and shared memory.
- Executes instructions in parallel via warps/wavefronts.

### 2. Shader Cores / ALUs
- Handle graphics and compute tasks.
- Use SIMD architecture for massive parallelism.

### 3. Texture Units
- Perform sampling, filtering, and coordinate mapping for images.

### 4. Raster Engine
- Converts triangles (vector data) into pixels.

### 5. Render Output Units (ROPs)
- Final stage of the graphics pipeline.
- Handles blending, depth testing, and writes pixels to the framebuffer.

### 6. Memory System
- **L1 Cache:** Closest, fastest.
- **L2 Cache:** Shared across SMs.
- **VRAM (GDDR6, HBM):** Main GPU memory.

### 7. Command Processor
- Receives and schedules commands from the CPU.

### 8. Graphics & Compute Engines
- **Graphics Engine:** Handles shading stages.
- **Compute Engine:** Handles GPGPU tasks (e.g., CUDA, ML).

### 9. Warp Scheduler
- Determines which threads (warps) to execute next.

### 10. Display Engine
- Interfaces with monitor; manages frame output and resolutions.
