# How a CPU Works: Components and Instruction Execution

## üß† 1. What is the CPU?

The **CPU** (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of a computer that performs:
- Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, etc.)
- Logic operations (comparisons, AND, OR, etc.)
- Data movement (load/store)
- Control flow (jumps, loops, branches)

---

## üèóÔ∏è 2. Major Components of a CPU

### 2.1 Control Unit (CU)
- **Function**: Directs the operation of the processor.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Fetch instructions from memory
  - Decode instructions
  - Control timing and signal coordination

### 2.2 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- **Function**: Performs all arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Examples**:
  - Addition, Subtraction
  - AND, OR, XOR
  - Comparisons: <, >, ==

### 2.3 Registers
- **Function**: Small, fast memory locations inside the CPU.
- **Types**:
  - **Program Counter (PC)**: Holds the address of the next instruction.
  - **Instruction Register (IR)**: Holds the current instruction.
  - **Accumulator (ACC)** or **General-Purpose Registers (R0-Rn)**: Temporary data storage for computations.
  - **Status Register** (FLAGS): Holds comparison results (Zero, Carry, Negative, etc.)

### 2.4 Clock
- **Function**: Synchronizes all CPU operations.
- **Cycles per second** = Clock speed (e.g., 3 GHz = 3 billion cycles/second)

### 2.5 Buses
- **Address Bus**: Carries memory addresses.
- **Data Bus**: Carries data to/from CPU.
- **Control Bus**: Carries control signals (read/write, etc.)

### 2.6 Cache
- **L1, L2, L3 Cache**: Small, fast memory close to CPU.
- Stores frequently accessed data and instructions.

## üîÑ 3. Instruction Cycle (aka Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle)

Each instruction follows these **5 stages**:

### üßæ Step 1: Fetch
- **PC** holds the memory address of the next instruction.
- Address is sent to **Memory** via the Address Bus.
- Instruction is fetched and placed into the **IR (Instruction Register)**.
- PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.

### üß† Step 2: Decode
- **Control Unit** decodes the instruction in the IR.
- It figures out:
  - What the instruction is (e.g., ADD, SUB, LOAD)
  - What operands are needed
  - What resources (ALU, registers) are involved

### ‚ûï Step 3: Execute
- Actual operation is performed:
  - ALU does computation (e.g., ADD R1, R2 ‚Üí R3)
  - Data is moved between registers/memory
  - Branches or jumps are taken

### üìù Step 4: Memory Access (if needed)
- For instructions like `LOAD` or `STORE`, memory is accessed to fetch or save data.

### üèÅ Step 5: Write-back
- The result is written back to a register or memory.

## üî¨ 4. Example: How `ADD R1, R2, R3` Works

Instruction: Add contents of `R2` and `R3`, store in `R1`

| Stage        | Operation                             |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Fetch**    | Instruction fetched from memory using PC |
| **Decode**   | Control Unit decodes: ADD R1 ‚Üê R2 + R3   |
| **Execute**  | ALU adds contents of R2 and R3         |
| **Write-back** | Result stored in R1                   |

## üîÅ 5. Pipelining (Advanced Feature)

Modern CPUs use **pipelining** to improve performance:
- **Fetch, Decode, Execute** stages happen in parallel on different instructions.
- Think of it like an assembly line.

| Cycle | Stage 1 | Stage 2   | Stage 3   |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| T1    | Fetch A |           |           |
| T2    | Fetch B | Decode A  |           |
| T3    | Fetch C | Decode B  | Execute A |

## üí™ 6. Superscalar and Out-of-Order Execution

Advanced CPUs:
- Can execute **multiple instructions per cycle**.
- **Out-of-Order Execution**: Reorder instructions to avoid stalls.
- Use **Reorder Buffers**, **Register Renaming**, and **Branch Prediction**.

## üì¶ 7. Memory Hierarchy Overview

- **Registers** (fastest, smallest)
- **L1/L2 Cache**
- **Main RAM**
- **SSD/HDD** (slowest, largest)
