## üß© PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) ‚Äî Uses

PCIe is the standard interface for connecting GPUs and other peripheral devices to the CPU.

### ‚úÖ Main Uses

1. **Connecting GPU to CPU**  
   - Enables data transfer between CPU/system memory and GPU memory.
   - Used to load kernels, instructions, and data to the GPU.

2. **Boot and Load Kernels**  
   - Drivers and kernel modules are loaded via PCIe.

3. **General Compute and Graphics Work**  
   - Communication for rendering, video processing, gaming, etc.

4. **Limited Peer-to-Peer GPU Communication**  
   - Some peer-to-peer transfers are possible with driver support, but bandwidth is limited.

5. **Low-Cost, Widely Supported Interface**  
   - Available in all modern computers; cost-effective for most applications.

## üîó NVLink ‚Äî Uses

NVLink is NVIDIA‚Äôs high-speed interconnect designed for fast GPU-GPU and CPU-GPU communication.

### ‚úÖ Main Uses

1. **Multi-GPU Deep Learning Training**  
   - Speeds up training by enabling fast data transfer between GPUs.
   - Reduces training time for large models (e.g., LLMs, CNNs).

2. **Unified Memory Access Across GPUs**  
   - Enables GPUs to share memory and appear as one large memory space.

3. **Direct GPU-GPU Communication**  
   - Allows bypassing the CPU, reducing bottlenecks and latency.

4. **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**  
   - Used in NVIDIA DGX systems and supercomputers for scientific workloads.

5. **NVSwitch-Based Architectures**  
   - Allows scaling NVLink to support 8‚Äì32+ GPUs with full all-to-all bandwidth.
