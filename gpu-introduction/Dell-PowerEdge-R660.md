## üîß GPU-Related Architecture

### 1. **GPU Support (Inference + Acceleration)**
- **Supported GPU class**: Low-profile, passive-cooled GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA A2, T4, or similar 75W cards)
- Typically supports **up to 2 single-width GPUs** (due to 1U form factor and thermal limitations)
- **No support for high-power training GPUs** like A100 or H100 (they require 2U+)

### 2. **PCIe Expansion for GPUs**
- **Up to 3 PCIe Gen5 slots**, used for:
  - Low-power GPUs
  - NVMe storage cards
  - High-bandwidth NICs or accelerators
- GPUs connect via PCIe (Gen4/Gen5), with **direct-to-CPU lanes** for low latency

### 3. **CPU and Memory Architecture (Feeding the GPU)**
- Dual Intel Xeon 4th Gen (Sapphire Rapids) CPUs
  - Up to **112 cores total**
  - Supports **AVX-512, AMX** ‚Äì good for AI inference
- **DDR5 RAM** up to 8 TB @ 4800MT/s
  - High bandwidth memory helps keep GPUs fed with data
